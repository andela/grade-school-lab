#Grade School

In the end, you should be able to:

Add a student's name to the roster for a grade

+ Add Jim to grade 2.
+ OK.

Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade

+ Which students are in grade 2?
+ We've only got Jim just now.

Get a sorted list of all students in all grades. Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.

+ List all the students enrolled in school right now
+ Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe. Grade 3â€¦

Note that all our students only have one name. (It's a small town)


## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\fizz-buzz.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.

##Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning, and conditional statements  will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
